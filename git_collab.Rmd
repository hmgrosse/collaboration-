## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
onebed_rent <- read_csv("City_MedianRentalPrice_1Bedroom.csv")
state_price <- read_csv("Sale_Prices_State.csv")
```


Tidy Tuesday Question: What is the average sale price by state, in March 2008?

```{r, fig.width=19, fig.height=14, fig.alt= "This graph shows the average sale price of houses, in March of 2008. The most expensive homes average $400,000 (California), and the most inexpensive homes are under $100,000 (Oklahoma). There are some states that data was nit collected from, and those states are gray."}
states_map<- map_data("state") 

state_price %>% 
  mutate(RegionName = str_to_lower(`RegionName`)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_map(map = states_map,
           aes(map_id = RegionName,
               fill = `2008-03`,
               na.rm = TRUE)) +
  labs(title = "Average State Sale Price in March 2008", fill = "Sale Price", caption = "Graph by Hannah Grosse, data from Zillow, map from map_data") +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket", direction = -1) +
  theme_map() + 
  theme(legend.background = element_blank())
```
```{r}
state_price %>% 
  mutate( mean_price_2008 = rowMeans(select(.,`2008-03`:`2008-12`)), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  select(mean_price_2008, everything())

#colMeans(state_price[5,6], na.rm = TRUE)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
